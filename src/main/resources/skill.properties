speech-consumer=Voice is in the same position that social media was many years ago. A shiny new object and its path to the future is the same. \
  Brands need to understand how to develop medium-specific content, and incorporate it into the broader marketing strategy. \
  By now you know what your brand looks like. Your logo, mission statement, colors, social media and a website. \
  But what does it sound like? Is it male or female? Does it have a British accent? \
  We can create a Voice for your company. Whether your aim is to increase sales, bolster engagement, increase brand awareness, or encourage repeat buyers, \
  it is crucial that you identify that purpose. Would you like us to contact you?

speech-business=Alexa for Business is a service that enables organizations and employees to use Alexa to get more work done. With Alexa for Business, employees can use Alexa as \
  their intelligent assistant to be more productive in meeting rooms, at their desks, and even with the Alexa devices they already have at home. \
  Alexa provides a natural and intuitive way for people to interact with the technology they use every day. \
  Alexa Skills create personalized experiences and allow Alexa to do more, and there are already tens of thousands of skills available for people to use today. \
  Alexa for Business gives you the tools you need to manage Alexa devices at work, enroll your users, and assign skills at scale. \
